# Relational Database Modeling

## Objectives
In this project, the main objective is to create a simple relational data model using Python and PostgreSQL to simulate a real project at Sparkify, some music streaming startup. Sparkify team wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming application, but they don't have a database and all data are available only in JSON files generated by the app.

## How to run the scripts
First of all, you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed in your machine.
